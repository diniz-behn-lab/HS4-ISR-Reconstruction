# HS4-ISR-Reconstruction
Collection of R files that implement the Garrish method for ISR estimation from C-Peptide data along with 95% credible bounds. The method is implemenetd via a collection of R scripts and has been streamlined specifically for obtaining ISR estimates and ISR-derived metrics from data provide by the LEAD Center.

## List of files
The files that are included in the method are:
1. Data Preprocessing Scipt
2. Cohort Parameter estimation script
3. ISR estimation Mixed-Effect at the individual level
4. Complete cohort model execution in a loop file.
5. Preliminary results and analysis file.

6.
